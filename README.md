Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! This project is dedicated to documenting my journey in learning and implementing various Machine Learning (ML) techniques, starting with data preprocessing, simple regression models, and extending to more advanced topics in ML.

ðŸ“– Overview

The repository is organized to cover:
	1.	Data Preprocessing: Preparing raw data for ML models.
	2.	Regression Techniques: Simple regression, multiple regression, and more.
	3.	Classification Models: Logistic regression, decision trees, etc. (Coming soon).
	4.	Clustering Models: K-means, hierarchical clustering, etc. (Coming soon).
	5.	Deep Learning: Neural networks and beyond. (Planned).
	6.	Other ML Topics: Feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and more.

Each section includes:
	â€¢	A description of the method.
	â€¢	Code implementation with comments for clarity.
	â€¢	Examples with datasets for hands-on learning.

ðŸ›  Features
	â€¢	Beginner-Friendly: Simple explanations and well-commented code.
	â€¢	Step-by-Step Implementation: Starting from data preprocessing to advanced ML models.
	â€¢	Reusable Code: Modularized scripts that can be applied to other projects.
	â€¢	Visualizations: Plots and charts to understand the data and results better.
